## üß© Features in Detail

### Multi-Model Support
O.P.E.R.A.T.O.R supports various AI models, each with unique strengths:

| Model | Provider | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| GPT-4o | OpenAI | Advanced reasoning, code generation | General tasks, complex workflows |
| Qwen-2.5-VL 72B | Alibaba | Visual grounding, UI interaction | Precise element targeting |
| Gemini-2.5-Pro | Visual understanding, multimodal | Research, data analysis |
| UI-TARS | ByteDance | End-to-end GUI automation | Complex UI workflows |
| Claude 3 Opus | Anthropic | Safety, instruction-following | Sensitive tasks |
| Grok-1 | xAI | Real-time data, conversational | Interactive tasks |

### Execution Modes

1. **Step Planning (Default)**
   - Processes tasks step-by-step with validation
   - Provides detailed progress updates
   - Ideal for complex or critical tasks

2. **Action Planning (Autopilot)**
   - Plans complete sequence of actions upfront
   - More efficient for routine tasks
   - Reduces completion time

3. **YAML Planning (Recommended)**
   - Uses structured YAML for precise control
   - Enables complex workflow definitions
   - Provides transparency and reproducibility

### YAML Workflow Automation

Define complex workflows using YAML:

```yaml
name: Research Assistant
version: 1.0
tasks:
  - name: Search Academic Papers
    action: web.search
    params:
      query: "machine learning applications in healthcare"
      source: "google_scholar"
      limit: 5
    
  - name: Extract Key Findings
    action: ai.analyze
    params:
      content: "{{task_1.results}}"
      instructions: "Summarize key findings and methodologies"
    
  - name: Generate Report
    action: docs.create
    params:
      title: "Research Summary - {{date}}"
      content: "{{task_2.summary}}"
      format: "markdown"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PORT=3400
NODE_ENV=development
API_KEYS={
  "openai": "your-openai-key",
